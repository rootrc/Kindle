# ICS4Ufinal

This is a rouge-like game where you explore a semi-randomly generated series of dark, icy caves and caverns to reach the bottom. You have to discover optimal pathways down, avoid traps, and find various abilities in chestsâ€”all while your light source is diminishing and the clock is ticking down.
There are currently 58 different rooms, most with 2-3 different variations.
Written in Java, with Java Swing
Started in 2023, completed in 2025

To run the game, either download the zip file of the code or clone the repository, then run src/App.java

Known Bugs: 
* MiniMap may glitch out if too many rooms are added to it
* When taking damage or dying, the red filter may sometimes not cover the whole screen evenly
* Hits, especially explosions, may rarely knock you into a wall's hitbox, or even through it
* Teleportation traps have a very low chance to softlock you, especially on map 30 (you won't know which one this is)
